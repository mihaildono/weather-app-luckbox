Okay soooooooooooooooooo, I didn't really keep a timesheet, because we are
renovating at home and I had to work on that at the same time,
however looking at my commits:

day 1 morning ~3 hours:
Think about how the app should look and research(it was a bit hard to imagine all the
transitions by the descriptions, without visual examples).
Add initial data and widget layout as well as redux/logic
afternoon ~3 hours:
add rest of layout and rest of data

day 2 Morning ~1 hour
add recharts/less support

noon ~2 hours
Finish widget styling
finish functional part of app(error handling, current loc...)

night ~4 hours
finish charts
add parallax
change color on scroll

day 3: ~30mins
finish up app

NOTES:
I kind of got this challenge in an uncomfortable time for me, because we are
doing construction work at home(as mentioned before) and in 5 mins I am leaving
for a 500+ km cycling trip(I hope I survive). Some stuff are not polished and
may be missing, but I think for the given time I did most of the major stuff.
The challenge overall was pretty fun!

I will probably not have that much connections to the real world in the next
couple of days... You can try contacting me at: 0894643622 or at
mihailgeorgiev94@gmail.com , although response may be slow.


TECHNICAL NOTES:

Sometimes when I switch to phone layout in the browser, it does not resize
properly: try reloading switching back and forth

Transitions are still clunky

Some minor stuff are still not ready

There are no test, simply because I do not have time ;(

P.S. I have this semi-pro valorant player, can we tip the scales on him for
betting? :D
